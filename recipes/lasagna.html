    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="Lasagna-Recipe-f.webp" alt="lasagna with a fork in the background">
    <p>lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Cheese fillings</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>2 Cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Meat Sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Lasagna</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><strong>Prep Work</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Make the Meat Sauce</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles. </li>
    </ol>
