    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="Lasagna-Recipe-f.webp" alt="lasagna with a fork in the background">
    <p>"Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagna"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Cheese fillings</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>2 Cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Meat Sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Lasagna</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><strong>Prep Work</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Make the Meat Sauce</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375°.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Assemble</h2>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles</strong>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,</strong> and <strong>the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Bake</h2>
     <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> <em>Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</strong> to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Notes</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavor Enhancers:</strong> The <strong>hot sauce</strong> and <strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> are flavor enhancers and can’t be tasted outright. The hot sauce won’t make it hot/spicy. I use <a href="https://www.franksredhot.com/en-us/products/franks-redhot-original-cayenne-pepper-sauce"><strong>Frank's Hot Sauce.</strong></a></li>
        <li><strong>Marinara Sauce:</strong> I recommend using <a href="https://www.raos.com/products/marinara-sauce/"><strong>Rao’s marinara sauce</strong></a> for this recipe, it’s very high quality, lasagna is a labor of love that deserves quality ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Shred and grate the cheese from a block, avoid using packaged shredded/grated cheese for this recipe. Low moisture, whole milk mozzarella cheese melts the best. I use <a href="https://www.dragonecheese.com/en/products/mozzarella/whole-milk-mozzarella"><strong>Dragone mozzarella,</a> <a href="https://www.belgioioso.com/products/parmesan/">Belgioioso Parmesan,</a></strong> and<strong> <a href="https://galbanicheese.com/our-cheeses/dairy-aisle-cheeses-ricotta">Galbani Whole Milk Ricotta.</a></strong></li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong> No-boil lasagna noodles or fresh lasagna noodles can also be used for this recipe, neither of which need to be cooked first. Fresh lasagna noodles can be found in the deli section of the grocery store.</li>
        <li><strong>Casserole Dish:</strong> If your lasagna is very close to the top of your casserole dish, place a baking sheet underneath the casserole dish to catch any splatters of sauce, as it gets hot and bubbly toward the end. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07631GB1Y?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=thcoco-20&linkId=ab7229746322ea1f7c39889256c85405&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><strong>This is the Staub casserole dish</strong></a> that I use for this recipe and it fits this lasagna perfectly.
        </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Storage</h2>
     <p>Store in an airtight container and <strong>refrigerate for up to 3 days</strong> or <strong>freeze for up to 3 months.</strong> Leftovers do freeze well. </p>
     <h2>Make-Ahead Method:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Assemble</strong> as outlined but <strong>do not bake.</strong> Cover and <strong>refrigerate for up to 2 days</strong> or <strong>freeze for up to 3 months.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Thaw frozen lasagna completely</strong> before baking.</li>
        <li>Let chilled lasagna sit out at <strong>room temperature for 30 minutes</strong> prior to baking. Add an additional <strong>10 minutes</strong> to covered baking time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reheating Leftovers:</h2>
      <p>To reheat leftover lasagna, place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. <strong>Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.</strong></p>
